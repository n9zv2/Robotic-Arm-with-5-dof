This project involves the design and assembly of a 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm. The robotic arm is composed of modular segments and uses servo motors for articulation, providing a versatile and flexible structure for various applications.

## Components

1. **Base**:
   - Square platform for stability.

2. **Arm Segments**:
   - Cylindrical segments forming the arm.
   - Each segment is designed to house a servo motor for rotation and bending.

3. **Joints**:
   - Rotary joints connecting the arm segments.
   - Allows for articulation at each connection point.

4. **Servo Motors**:
   - Servo motors embedded within the arm segments.

5. **Gripper**:
   - End-effector designed to grasp objects.
   - Actuated by a servo motor for opening and closing.
